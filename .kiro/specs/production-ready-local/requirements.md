# Production-Ready Application Requirements - Local Development

## Introduction

This specification covers making the ICT Ticketportaal production-ready on the local XAMPP development environment. The goal is to ensure all functionality is complete, tested, optimized, and ready for deployment to production without requiring code changes. This includes completing any missing features, fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and ensuring security best practices are implemented.

## Glossary

- **Production-Ready**: Code that is complete, tested, secure, and optimized for deployment
- **XAMPP**: Local development environment (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- **Code Freeze**: Point where no new features are added, only bug fixes
- **Technical Debt**: Code that needs refactoring or improvement
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual or extreme scenarios that need handling
